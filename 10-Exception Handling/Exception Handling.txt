An exception is an error that happens during execution of a program. When that error occurs, Python generate an exception that can be handled, which avoids your
program to crash.


Types of Exceptions:
-------------------

1. IOError : If the file cannot be opened.

2. ImportError :  If python cannot find the module.

3. ValueError :  Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.

4. KeyboardInterrupt : Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (normally Control-C or Delete).

5. EOFError : Raised when one of the built-in functions (input() or raw_input()) hits an end-of-file condition (EOF) without reading any data.


Exception Handling Blocks:
--------------------------

try:
    some statements here
except:
    exception handling


Example:
--------

import sys
print "Lets fix the previous code with exception handling"
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number between 1 - 10"))
except ValueError:
    print "Error : numbers only"
    sys.exit()
print "you entered number", number


Try...Except....Else Clause in Python
--------------------------------------

try:
    data = something_that_can_go_wrong
except IOError:
    handle_the_exception_error
else:
    doing_different_exception_handling



Try..finally clause:
--------------------

try:
    data = something_that_can_go_wrong
finally:
	code_must_be_executed_under_all_circumstances
