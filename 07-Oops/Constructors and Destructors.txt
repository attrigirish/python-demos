Constructor and Destructor

Constructor

Constructor is a special member function. A constructor can be called only once in an object's life cycle. Constructors cannot be called explicitly. A constructor invokes automatically whenever a new object is created of a class.

Declaration:


def __init__():
	<function definition>


Destructor is opposit to a constructor. Destructor function is used to release any occupied resource before an object terminates. Like a constructor, destructor function cannot be called explicitly. A destructor function get called when an object terminates.

def __del__():
	<function definition>
